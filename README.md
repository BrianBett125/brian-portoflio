íº€ Brian Bett Portfolio

A modern, responsive personal portfolio built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, showcasing my projects, skills, and experience. This portfolio is AI-assisted, leveraging next-generation AI-native tooling (Trae) for scaffolding, testing, and review workflows.

í³¦ Tech Stack

âœ” Language: TypeScript
âœ” Frontend Framework: React (with Vite as the build tool)
âœ” Styling: TailwindCSS (utility-first CSS)
âœ” Animations: Framer Motion
âœ” Icons: React Icons
âœ” Forms: TailwindCSS Forms plugin
âœ” Deployment: Vercel (CI/CD ready)
âœ” Version Control: Git + GitHub

âœ… Database and backend not required for this project, but optional integrations (e.g., Django REST API or Firebase) may be added later.

í´– AI Integration Plan
í·± Code or Feature Generation

âœ” AI (Trae IDE + ChatGPT) will scaffold portfolio components, such as:
âœ” Navbar.tsx â†’ Responsive navigation with smooth scroll
âœ” Hero.tsx â†’ Landing intro with CTA buttons
âœ” Projects.tsx â†’ Grid layout for project cards
âœ” Timeline.tsx â†’ Education & experience timeline
âœ” Prompts will drive component creation and styling, ensuring responsive design and consistent UI/UX.

ï¿½ï¿½ Testing Support

âœ” AI will generate unit tests for reusable components (e.g., Navbar rendering, form validation in Contact section).
âœ” AI will help design integration tests for form submission flows using Jest + React Testing Library.
âœ” Sample AI tasks:
âœ” Suggest edge cases for Contact form input validation.
âœ” Scaffold Jest test suites with TypeScript typings pre-configured.

í³¡ Schema-Aware / API-Aware Generation

âœ” If I later connect this portfolio to an API (e.g., projects from a CMS or blog posts from an API):
âœ” AI will generate API hooks (useProjects.ts, useBlogPosts.ts) based on schema or OpenAPI definitions.
âœ” AI can scaffold TypeScript interfaces for responses and requests to reduce manual typing.

í´ In-Editor / PR Review Tooling

âœ” AI Tool: Trae IDE (AI-native), supplemented by GitHub Copilot or CodeRabbit for PR review.
âœ” PR Support:
âœ” Generate clear commit messages.
âœ” Suggest improvements in code style, accessibility, and performance.
âœ” Provide inline feedback on React patterns and Tailwind usage.

âœï¸ Prompting Strategy
Example 1 â€” Component Scaffolding
Create a responsive Navbar component in React + TypeScript with TailwindCSS. 
Include links: Home, About, Projects, Experience, Contact. 
On desktop â†’ inline menu. On mobile â†’ hamburger menu with sliding sidebar. 
Highlight the active section on scroll. Use React Icons for the hamburger.

Example 2 â€” Test Generation
Write Jest + React Testing Library unit tests for ContactForm.tsx. 
Cover these cases:
- Renders all input fields
- Shows validation error if fields are empty
- Calls onSubmit with correct data when filled

íº§ Roadmap

âœ” [x] Initialize project with Vite + React + TypeScript
âœ” [x] Configure TailwindCSS
âœ” [ ] Add Navbar, Hero, Projects, Timeline, and Contact components
âœ” [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
âœ” [ ] Add animations (Framer Motion)
âœ” [ ] Deploy on Vercel
